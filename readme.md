## WeatherData
Calculates meta information and smoothes weather data

### Description
Explains how to postprocess graph data and how to calculate meta information
like minima and maxima using the profile API.

### How to Run
This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. Use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 to edit the UI.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine 2.5 or higher is necessary.
For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the
Emulator on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
